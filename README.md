# The-Goofy-Geeks
Our team The-Goofy-Geeks part of the FLC Hackfest 2022-23 has chosen full stack web development selecting topic 2 regarding providing updates on any events/event details conducted by different student clubs.
In this project, we have created a website where it helps the students of our college to get updates of an event as most of the time information regarding the events/activites fails to reach the students or sometimes becomes complicated in searching for an event and to register for it.

Our website will help students to get updates of the events and register for it.
The website consists of a student login and an admin login. The students have to sign up for the website before using it.
We will be be providing a password for the admins of each club for them to add events of their choice to the website.
Students can sort the events by date and by popularity for their ease to search for an event.
Further, the students can even use filter to search for technical, non-technical clubs and also the events.
